# Overview
### Welcome to my analysis of the data job market, focusing on data analyst roles. This project was created out of a desire to navigate and understand the job market more effectively. It delves into the top-paying and in-demand skills to help find optimal job opportunities for data analysts.

The data sourced from [Luke Barousse's Python Course](https://www.lukebarousse.com/python)
which provides a foundation for my analysis, containing detailed information on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills. Through a series of Python scripts, I explore key questions such as the most demanded skills, salary trends, and the intersection of demand and salary in data analytics.
# The Questions ‚ÅâÔ∏è
Below are the questions I want to answer in my project:

1-  What are the skills most in demand for the top 3 most popular data roles?     
2 - How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?         
3 - How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?        
4 - What are the optimal skills for data analysts to learn? (High Demand AND High Paying)    

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:       
‚Ä¢ Python: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to analyze the data and find critical insights.I also used the following Python libraries:         
‡ßπ Pandas Library: This was used to analyze the data.        
‡ßπ Matplotlib Library: I visualized the data.       
‡ßπ Seaborn Library: Helped me create more advanced visuals.       
‚Ä¢ Jupyter Notebooks: The tool I used to run my Python scripts which let me easily include my notes and analysis.       
‚Ä¢ Visual Studio Code: My go-to for executing my Python scripts.       

## Data Preparation and Cleanup
This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.
### Import & Clean Up Data
I start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.

#### Importing Libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

##### Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

####  Data Cleanup 

df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notnull(x) else [])

##### Filter Indian jobs

To focus my analysis on the Indian job market, I apply filters to the dataset, narrowing down to roles based in the India .
df_india=df[(df['job_country']=='India')]

# The Analysis
## 1. What are the most demanding skills for top 3 data roles
## to find the most demanded skills for the top three most popular data roles, I filtered those positions by popularity and identified the top five skills for each of these roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I should pay attention to depending on the role¬†I¬†am¬†targeting.

        ax[i].text(v+2,n-0.1,f'{v:.0f}%',va='center',fontsize=8)

### Insights üí°
-SQL is a versatile skill, highly demanded across all three roles, but most prominently for data  engineers (63%) and data analysts (49%). 

-Python is the most requested skill for data scientists and data engineers, appearing in over half the job postings for both roles.

-For data analysts, SQL is the most sought-after skill, appearing in 49% of job postings. Data analysts require more technical skills like excel, tableau, power bi.

-data engineers required cloud based skills like AWS, Azure, and Spark compared to data analysts and data scientists

### üìå Top-Level Insights:
SQL is consistently the most in-demand skill, maintaining demand levels above 50% throughout the year, peaking around May and again in December.

Python holds the second position in most months, showing relatively stable demand in the 35‚Äì45% range, with minor fluctuations.

Excel, Tableau, and Power BI are the next tier of skills, with Excel slightly ahead overall, though all three show similar trends and occasional crossovers in demand.

## üí° Key Insights:
1. High Salary, Low Prevalence Tools:
Looker, PowerPoint, Power BI and Tableau (Analyst Tools & Libraries) offer high salaries (~$110k) despite low usage (<25%).

These are specialized tools that, though less common, are highly valued in organizations that use them.

2. Widely Used, Moderate Salary Tools:
SQL (48%), Excel (42%), and Python (40%) are the most commonly required skills, offering salaries around $950k to $980k.

These are considered foundational skills for Data Analysts, often expected across the board.

3. Cloud Tools Offer Moderate Pay and Usage:
Azure and AWS show moderate usage (~15%) and salaries around $940k and $800k, respectively.

Shows cloud tools are valuable but not yet widespread in traditional data analyst roles.

4. Low Salary, Low Usage Tools:
Word and Oracle show low relevance both in salary and skill percent‚Äîindicating they are less optimal for aspiring data analysts.

5. Programming vs. Analyst Tools:
Programming skills like Python and SQL are essential but don‚Äôt yield the highest salaries alone.

Analyst tools like Power BI and Tableau tend to bring higher pay despite being less commonly used, suggesting a niche value.
