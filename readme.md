## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights:
1. High Salary, Low Prevalence Tools:
Looker, PowerPoint, Power BI and Tableau (Analyst Tools & Libraries) offer high salaries (~$110k) despite low usage (<25%).

These are specialized tools that, though less common, are highly valued in organizations that use them.

2. Widely Used, Moderate Salary Tools:
SQL (48%), Excel (42%), and Python (40%) are the most commonly required skills, offering salaries around $950k to $980k.

These are considered foundational skills for Data Analysts, often expected across the board.

3. Cloud Tools Offer Moderate Pay and Usage:
Azure and AWS show moderate usage (~15%) and salaries around $940k and $800k, respectively.

Shows cloud tools are valuable but not yet widespread in traditional data analyst roles.

4. Low Salary, Low Usage Tools:
Word and Oracle show low relevance both in salary and skill percentâ€”indicating they are less optimal for aspiring data analysts.

5. Programming vs. Analyst Tools:
Programming skills like Python and SQL are essential but donâ€™t yield the highest salaries alone.

Analyst tools like Power BI and Tableau tend to bring higher pay despite being less commonly used, suggesting a niche value.
